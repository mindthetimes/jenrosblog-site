# Jenro's Blog 
## jenrosblog.site

Welcome to my blog. It is a fairly basic website, wherein I put some effort into getting myself out there and seeing where I actually fit in with the web. I’m seeing the changes we have been going through in technology, and I am making a stand here in trying to get to it, wherever that may be.

I am keen on my observations that there is indeed a problem, so to speak, and that the vibrance and interest in the web wasn’t as it was in my younger years. A revitalization may be amply needed on my part regarding that matter, and I hope to be capable in doing so.

By sharing it in part with you, I believe that I am able to create something of utmost value, something that I feel is being lost nowadays. It all seems rudimentary at the moment, but it is part of our coexistence with the modern world.

Can we just be open about the times? I hope it could be as simple as that.
